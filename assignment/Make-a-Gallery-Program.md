## Make a Gallery Program

Here is an example of a Gallery Program:

<https://show.mat.ucsb.edu>



**Let us make one:**

1) Go to your business card repository on GitHub. Mine is <https://github.com/kybr/kybr.github.io>

2) Select "Add file / Create new file"

3) In the box, name the file "gallery/index.html". Paste in this HTML:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>Gallery Program</title>
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
     </head>
     <body>

       <h1>Title of Project 1</h1>
       <h4>by Your Name</h4>
       <img src="project1.jpg" width="500" />
       <p>This is my abstract</p>

       <br/>
       <br/>
       <hr/>

       <h1>Title of Project 2</h1>
       <h4>by Your Name</h4>
       <img src="project2.jpg" width="500" />
       <p>This is my abstract</p>

       <br/>
       <br/>
       <hr/>

       <h1>Title of Project 3</h1>
       <h4>by Your Name</h4>
       <img src="project3.jpg" width="500" />
       <p>This is my abstract</p>

     </body>
   </html>
   ```

4) Click "Commit changes..." and then click "Commit changes"

5) Point your browser at your business card site. Mine is <https://kybr.github.io>

   - ...but append "gallery", so you have something like this:
   - <https://kybr.github.io/gallery>

6) Wait a minute and refresh the page

7) Now add your images. Goto your GitHub repository. Mine is <https://github.com/kybr/kybr.github.io>.

8) Click on "gallery"

9) Select "Add file / Upload files"

10) Choose your 3 image files that represent your projects and upload them.

11) Go back to "gallery/index.html" and edit the file such that the `<img ...>` tags refer to your new image files.



**Due Monday by 5pm:**

For each of your projects, make the necessary elements: Title, Author list, Image, Abstract. Add these to your Gallery Program site by filling in the appropriate HTML tags with your content. Make a QR code that leads to the URL of your gallery and bring that QR code to class on Tuesday.

Email a link to your gallery to <yerkes@ucsb.edu>. **Make the subject exactly this "gallery banana".** I will search my email for "gallery banana" to find your link. I mean your gallery, not your business card. Mine is <https://kybr.github.io/gallery>. What is yours?
